Founded in 1994, the Blue Lights are the heartthrobs of Colby's a cappella community. 
The Blue Lights are all about good vibes and performing to entertain, working just hard 
enough to sound good while still remembering to have fun with it. Read on for concert 
footage, announcements, and an inside look at what it's like to be a Blue Light.
